# What is SmartFood
SmartFood is a Smart Contract framework to keep track of grocery (food) products from the raw materials to the consumer . This system is powered by the Ethereum Blockchain, so it's fully distributed, immutable and auditable. 
# How it works
Every Product is represented in a Smart Contract, which keeps track of actions being made by Ethereum accounts. The community (could be a government, a consortium or even a DAO) in charge of SmartFood can register new accounts as official Product Handlers.  Their identity is stored in the Blockchain, making it impossible for others to use it.
Any consumer, government or regulatory institution can scan a QR code on the product packaging, which identifies the Smart Contract representing the exact product (down to item level)... and linkage to smart contract to see the full train and current stage of product lifecycle. 
Anyone will be also able to see all the actions all particpants performed on SmartFood Products, empowering a more transparent and fair marketplace.
